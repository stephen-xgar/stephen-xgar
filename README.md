-Hi, I'm Stephen Myall—a tech enthusiast and advocate for open-source solutions, especially Linux. I love streamlining workflows and making complex tasks more efficient, whether it’s through the power of LaTeX and Overleaf for documentation or Linux for improving system performance and security.

When I'm not working on digital transformation projects for Northside Partnership in Ireland, you’ll find me exploring new ways to automate processes and improve productivity. I'm passionate about creating accessible, user-friendly solutions that make life easier for everyone.

Feel free to connect and collaborate
